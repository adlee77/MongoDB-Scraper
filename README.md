## NPR Music News Scraper
I'm a lifelong musician with a degree in music from University of California, Santa Barbara. Therefore, music has and always will be a passion of mine. I like to stay updated on the world of music and what's going on in the music industry.

This app helps me keep track of all music-related news directly from NPR's Music section. Sometimes, I don't have time to check NPR's site daily, so I use this app to scrape articles I find interesting and plan on reading later. I can even add notes and messages about these articles for later.

# Technologies Used
* Cheerio for scraping articles.
* Handlebars for layout.
* Bootstrap for styling.
* MongoDB for database storage.
